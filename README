With the rapid advancement of computer and information technology, traditional categories for research papers often fail to reflect emerging multidisciplinary fields, making it challenging for users to find relevant research. To address this, we propose a research paper classification system based on metadata, particularly titles and abstracts, due to their public availability. Using feature selection and TF-IDF vectors, we trained a neural network classifier, achieving an accuracy of 77.78% and a precision of 81%. These results highlight the potential for further improvements by exploring advanced classification methods and text representation techniques.
